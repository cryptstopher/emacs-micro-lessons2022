#+TITLE: Micro Lesson #3 - Installing Packages

* Two Package Managers

Default: ~elpa~
Other: ~melpa~

(There may be more, I don't know.)

* From The Config File

This is not my recipe, but I use it to augment the default package
manager with the Melpa package manager.

#+begin_src elisp
  (require 'package)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
  (package-initialize)
  (unless package-archive-contents
  (package-refresh-contents))
  (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
    (package-install 'use-package))
  (require 'use-package)
  (setq use-package-always-ensure t)
#+end_src

* How To Install Packages

It's good to first refresh packages:

~M-x package-refresh-contents~

Even though the code above should have done this, it does not always
take.

Then you can to the package install function:

~M-x package-install~
